-Every dozens of seconds a group of 3 space freighters will go across the screen. Player will need to protect them from being hit by asteroids.<br>
-If all freighters get through safely, player will get an extra life.<br>
-If 1 or 2 freighters get through safely, player will get major bonus score for each freighter.<br>
-If all freighters are destroyed, player will lose 1 life.<br>
-There is some chance a freighter will drop a thunderbolt item, which player gains higher shooting rate if picked up.<br>
